# Just a little quiz thing ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

## DOM

### 1. What will happen when you run the following code?

```javascript
const buttons = document.getElementsByClassName('button')
buttons.addEventListener("click", function(e){
    console.log(e.target)
})    
```
```
Nothing - the event listener is being called on a collection of buttons which won't work
```

### Use the following HTML to answer the rest of the questions.

```html
<div id="container">
    <h4>This is a cool heading!</h4>
    <ul class="list">
        <li>The first list item</li>
        <li>The second list item</li>
    </ul>
    <p>This is a random "p" tag with a <span>SPAN</span> inside of it for some reason!</p>
    <li>This list item clearly makes no sense here!!! Who wrote this horrible code?</li>
</div>
```

### 2. Provide the JavaScript code that would get the second list item from the DOM and save it to a variable called `secondListItem`.

```javascript

const secondListItem = secondListItem = document.querySelectorAll('li')[1]

```

### 3. Once you have the `secondListItem` node, how could you traverse the DOM tree to get the `<p>` tag.


```javascript
secondListItem.parentElement.nextElementSibling
```

### 4. What query could you do to get just the `li` tags that are inside the `ul` and not that random janky one that's near the bottom for some reason?


```javascript
document.querySelectorAll('ul > li')
```

## Events

### 5. Why do we use a `DOMContentLoaded` listener?

```
Load all HTML content before running JS
```

### 6. What type of element does a `submit` event happen to?

```
Form
```

### 7. What attribute of an `input` element can we use to easily retrieve data from form inputs?

```
Value
```

### 8. What are the 2 required parameters we have to pass into a call to `addEventListener`?

```
Event, callback function
```

## Fetch

### 9. Write the code to do a GET `fetch` request to "notarealwebsite.com" and log the response from the server to the console.

```javascript

fetch("www.notarealwebsite.com")
  .then(function(response) {
    return response.json();
  })
  .then(function(object) {
    console.log(object);
  })

```

### 10. Following RESTful conventions (see [restular.com](http://www.restular.com) if you need a bit of help with that), write the `fetch` request to update the `user` record with an id of 1 at the URL "notarealwebsite.com".

```javascript
const formData = {
    name : 'Jessica'
}

let configObj = {
  method: "patch"
  headers: {
    "Content-Type": "application/json",
    "Accept": "application/json"
  },
  body: JSON.stringify(formData)
};

fetch("notarealwebsite.com/user" + ${user_id}, configObj)
  .then(function(response) {
    return response.json();
  })
  .then(function(object) {
    console.log(object);
  })

```

### 11. What effect does the following fetch request have in the database? What does the following fetch request *return*? 

```javascript
fetch("notarealwebsite.com/dogs/25", {
    method: "DELETE"
})
```

```

```

## Datasets

### 12. Write the HTML to create a `div` element with a dataset property of "awesome" set to a value of "Steven is".

```HTML

```

### 13. In JavaScript, how would you get the `div` element from the question above from the DOM using `document.querySelector` and the dataset?

```javascript

```

### 14. Write the JavaScript to create a `marquee` element with a dataset property of "jaws" set to a value of "great movie".

```javascript

```

### 15. In JavaScript, how would you access the "jaws" dataset property? How would you change its value to "overrated maybe"?

```javascript

```
